 // According to Swift's piecemeal adoption plan features that were
 // upcoming features that become language defaults and are still enabled
 // as upcoming features will result in a compiler error. Currently in the
 // latest 5.10 compiler this doesn't happen, the compiler ignores it.
 //
 // If the situation does change and enabling default language features
 // does result in an error in future versions we attempt to guard against
 // this by using the hasFeature(x) compiler directive to see if we have a
 // feature already, or if we can enable it. It's safe to enable features
 // that don't exist in older compiler versions as the compiler will ignore
 // features it doesn't have implemented.
